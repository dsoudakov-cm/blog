# Testing Auto-Generation

This is a test post to verify that our GitHub Actions workflow for auto-generating blog entries is working correctly after fixing the permissions issue.

The workflow should:
1. Detect this new content file
2. Create an auto-generated entry in `content/auto-generated/`
3. Build and deploy the updated site

Let's see if it works!
