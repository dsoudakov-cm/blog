Summary: Final test to verify the auto-blog workflow works correctly after fixing the grep command.

# Final Workflow Test

This is the final test to verify that our auto-blog workflow is working correctly after fixing the line break issue in the grep command.

The workflow should now:
1. Properly detect this new `.md` file
2. Create an auto-generated blog entry in the `content/auto-generated/` directory
3. Commit and push the changes with `[skip-blog]` flag
4. Trigger the deploy workflow to build and deploy the updated site

This should be the successful test!
